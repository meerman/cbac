== Installation

Finished generating the basic user authentication system. There are still a few things you have to
do manually. First open your application.rb and add

  require_dependency "basic_auth"

to the top of the file and include the login system by adding

  include BasicAuth

to the ApplicationController class.

Your application.rb file should look something like this:

	require_dependency "basic_auth"

	class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
	  include BasicAuth
	end

Setup your database for your application and run rake migrate to create the user table. 

	rake db:migrate
	rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test
	rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production
	
Configure your mail settings in environment.rb. E.g. for smtp you might add something like the following to environment.rb

	ActionMailer::Base.delivery_method = :smtp
	ActionMailer::Base.smpt_settings = {
	  :address => "mail.mydomain.com",
	  :port => 25,
	  :domain => "mydomain.com",
	  :user_name => "MyUsername",
	  :password => "MyPassword",
	  :authentication => :login
	}

Run the tests to check if everything is working ok

	rake test
	
You can now protect actions by adding 

	before_filter :login_required
	
to your controllers

See http://www.aidanf.net/rails_user_authentication_tutorial for a description of the code.
