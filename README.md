# Context Based Access Control _(cbac)_

> Easy to use, light-weight authorization system for Rails applications.

Context Based Access Control allows you to build a Rails application with both generic roles as well as context roles. The generic role part allows an application to authorize users with a conventional role system. The context part allows an application to authorize with a combination of the user credentials and the context of the requested action.

## Install
The gem can be installed using the 'gem' command: `gem install cbac`

Please use the correct version of _cbac_ in your `Gemfile`:
- for Rails 3 and lower: `gem 'cbac', '~> 0.6.10'`
- for Rails 4: `gem 'cbac', '~> 0.7.0'`
- for Rails 5: `gem 'cbac', '~> 0.8.0'`
